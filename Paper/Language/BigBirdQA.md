## About random walk

> As a consequence, such a random graph approximates the complete graph spectrally and its second eigenvalue (of the adjacency matrix) is quite far from the first eigenvalue. This property leads to a rapid mixing time for random walks in the graph, which informally suggests that information can flow fast between any pair of nodes.
